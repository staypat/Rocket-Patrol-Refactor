//   -Create a new scrolling tile sprite for the background
//  3-Point Tier: 
//   -Create 4 new explosion sound effects and randomize which one plays on impact
//   -Display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen
//  5-Point Tier: 
//   -Create a new enemy Spaceship type (w/ new artwork) that's smaller, moves faster, and is worth more points
